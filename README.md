#Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

Project Overview
Project Title: Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis
Tool Used: Microsoft Power BI

This project analyzes marketing campaign performance across multiple digital channels such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Google Search. The goal is to evaluate campaign effectiveness, track conversions, measure ROI, understand audience behavior, and identify the most profitable marketing strategies.

Using DAX measures, interactive filters, and visually rich dashboards, this project transforms raw marketing data into actionable insights that can help businesses optimize budget allocation, improve targeting, and increase overall campaign profitability.

Executive Summary

The dataset consisted of 20,000+ marketing records covering campaign budgets, impressions, clicks, conversions, revenue, gender, age groups, and audience types (new vs. returning).

Using Power BI, the dataset was cleaned, modeled, and visualized into an interactive dashboard that helps marketing teams quickly understand:

Which channels perform best

Which campaigns generate maximum ROI

How different age groups and genders respond

Audience type differences in CTR and conversion performance

Profitability and spending patterns across channels

The final dashboard enables data-driven marketing decisions with clarity and efficiency.

⭐ Key Highlights

Built interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers for audience type and marketing channel.

Created 10+ DAX measures, including CTR, Conversion Rate, Total Spend, Total Revenue, and ROI.

Visualized campaign performance using bar charts, donut charts, line graphs, KPI cards, and tables.

Identified Top 5 campaigns by ROI using calculated measures.

Displayed performance breakdown by age, gender, audience type, and channel.

Designed a clean, professional layout using color themes and consistent visual formatting.

Analyzed engagement patterns across multiple platforms (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.).

🎯 Impact

This dashboard improves marketing strategy by helping teams understand:

Where ad spend generates the highest returns

Which demographics convert best

How different platforms perform in terms of CTR and CPA

Overall profitability of campaigns
